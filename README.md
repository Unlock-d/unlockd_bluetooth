## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using Unlockd Bluetooth you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your
machine.**

Add `unlockd_bluetooth` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  unlockd_bluetooth:
```

Install it:

```sh
flutter packages get
```

## Continuous Integration ü§ñ

Unlockd Bluetooth comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered
by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code
remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project
uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage
is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].

---
